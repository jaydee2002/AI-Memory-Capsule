## 💡 **Project Overview**

**AI Memory Capsule** is an innovative, futuristic web application that allows users to create time-locked digital capsules — personal messages, videos, or audio that can be unlocked in the future or on special events (birthdays, graduations, etc.).

The app integrates **AI** to generate emotional reflections on your messages and uses **blockchain-inspired hashing** to ensure your memories are tamper-proof and secure.

---

## 🚀 **Key Features**

- ✉️ **Create future messages** in text, audio, or video form.
- ⏰ **Time-lock your capsules** — only open after a specific date/time.
- 🧠 **AI-generated emotional reflections** using GPT to summarize and reflect on your message.
- 🔒 **Blockchain-style integrity hash** for tamper detection.
- 📥 **File storage on AWS S3** for scalable, secure media storage.
- 📧 **Automated email notifications** when capsules unlock.
- ✅ **JWT-based authentication and user management**.
- ⚡ **Modern, polished UI** with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion animations.

## ⚙️ **Setup & Run Locally**

### 1️⃣ Backend

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/memory-capsule-backend.git
cd memory-capsule-backend
./mvnw clean package
docker build -t memory-capsule-backend .
docker run -p 8080:8080 memory-capsule-backend
````

Or run locally (without Docker):

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

#### Configure `application.yml`

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/memory_capsule
    username: root
    password: your_password
  mail:
    host: smtp.gmail.com
    port: 587
    username: your_email@gmail.com
    password: your_app_password

aws:
  s3:
    bucketName: your-s3-bucket
    accessKeyId: your-access-key
    secretAccessKey: your-secret-key
    region: your-region

openai:
  apiKey: your_openai_api_key
```

---

### 2️⃣ Frontend

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/memory-capsule-frontend.git
cd memory-capsule-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Configure `.env`

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
```
